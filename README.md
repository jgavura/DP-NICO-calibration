Description: Objective of this thesis is to propose a cheap and easy solution to robotic calibration, minimizing the error (reality gap) that occurs when transfering
from simulation space into physical world. We worked with humanoid robot NICO.

Thesis goals:

1. 2D calibration based on haptic feedback - finished
2. Object grasping optimization - working
3. 3D calibration based on visual feedback - working
