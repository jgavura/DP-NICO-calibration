# Calendar of my work on this project

- Week 1 (24.2.2025 - 2.3.2025): Getting to know the libraries used for working with NICO. Learning to control the NICO in simulation.

- Week 2 (3.3.2025 - 9.3.2025): Trying out movements with the real NICO in physical world and learning its limits.

- Week 3 (10.3.2025 - 16.3.2025): Preparing the robot for testing using the touchscreen in front of him. Had to approximate Z value for different X, Y points on the touchscreen using linear interpolation because of reality gap.

- Week 4 (17.3.2025 - 23.3.2025): Testing 2D accuracy with a baseline linear model.

- Week 5 (24.3.2025 - 30.3.2025): Brainstorming ideas for minimalizing the errors measured last week.

- Week 6 (31.3.2025 - 6.4.2025): Training neural network that approximates X, Y in sim from target X, Y in real world (Model 2 - partially nonlinear, still uses linear interpolation for finding Z)

- Week 7 (7.4.2025 - 13.4.2025): Testing 2D accuracy with model 2

- Week 8 (14.4.2025 - 20.4.2025): Training neural network that approximates X, Y, Z in sim from target X, Y in real world (Model 3 - nonlinear, does not use any interpolation)

- Week 9 (21.4.2025 - 27.4.2025): Testing 2D accuracy with model 3

- Week 10 (28.4.2025 - 4.5.2025): Producing and comparing the results.

- Week 11 (5.5.2025 - 11.5.2025): Preparing the presentation
